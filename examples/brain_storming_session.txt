========== Brainstorming the story plot ==========

    Our story could revolve around a group of young adults who travel to Iceland for a summer adventure. They encounter love, friendship, and some comedic mishaps along the way. Two hawks they befriend become symbolic of their journey. The early 2000's setting will add a nostalgic touch.

    That sounds like a great starting point. We could have the hawks represent the two main characters' love story, with their ups and downs mirroring the humans' own romantic journey. The comedic mishaps could stem from cultural misunderstandings and the challenges of navigating a foreign country.

========== Brainstorming the story line Characters with names with descriptions ==========

    ---------- Artistic Director ----------
    Great, let's start defining our characters. We'll need diverse and relatable characters that our target audience can connect with. Here is a quick overview:

    1. Emma - The main protagonist, a quirky and adventurous spirit who is also a hopeless romantic.
    2. Jack - Emma's best friend, a practical joker who falls in love in the most unexpected place.
    3. Lily - The shy and introverted member of the group, who discovers her own strength throughout the journey.
    4. Max - The planner of the group, Max is meticulous and organized but also a bit of a worrywart.
    5. Sofia - The free-spirited and spontaneous one, Sofia is always ready for an adventure.
    6. Ethan - The quiet and mysterious one, Ethan has a secret that will surprise everyone.
    7. Olivia - The mature and sensible one, Olivia often acts as the group's voice of reason.

    For the hawks:
    1. Freya - A majestic hawk that the group often sees soaring above them, representing freedom and adventure.
    2. Loki - A mischievous hawk that frequently steals their food, adding a touch of humor to the story.

    These character descriptions provide a good starting point. I suggest we further develop their backstories and motivations to make them more three-dimensional. For instance, what drives Emma's adventurous spirit? Why is Jack a practical joker? This will help us create more engaging and relatable characters.
